        <div class="Sp">
            <h1>CV axle</h1> <img src="../Pic/cv.png" width="350px" height="270px">
            <p> CV axles are a modern drivetrain component that are found on most vehicles Their purpose is to transfer power from the transmission. This is what causes the vehicle to move forward. The black greasy flexible area is the joint, these allow the axle to flex according to the road conditions. The joints are usually covered with rubber boot that meat to protect if from debris and dirt.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>CV Axle Problems:</h3> <br>
            <h3>Clicking noise while turning</h3>
            <p>This is one of the most common sign of a failing CV axle. CV axles that are worn out tend to have loose joints. The longer you leave the CV axles in this condition the closer you may get into losing the CV axles completely and this will make the vehicle very dangerous to drive.</p><br>
            <h3>Grease on the edge of tire</h3>
            <p>
                Grease on the underside edge of the tire means that the rubber boot that is used to protect the CX axle joint is broken. Each time you turn the steering wheel while driving the grease is flicked around the inner edge of the tire. Leaving the rubber boot broken will expose the joint allow dirt and debris to enter and cause damage to it.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Excessive vibration while driving</h3>
            <p>
                Excessive vibration while driving is usually caused be a damage CV axle joint or axle shaft. Damage axle shaft can be out of balance while rotating. This is what causes the excessive vibrating while driving.
            </p> <br> <br>

            <a name="Transmission" />
            <h1>Transmission</h1>
            <img src="../Pic/Transmission.png" width="360px" height="220px">
            <p>This is what changes the gear ratios as the vehicle moves. There is automatic transmission (AT) and there is manual transmission (MT). With the AT the gear ratios will automatically change will drive so you do not have to do the work. The MT is does not automatically change the gear ratios so the driver must shift the gears manually.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Transmission Problems:</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Transmission is slipping </h3>
            <p>When the transmission is slipping it may feel as if the vehicle is on a certain gear and suddenly changes for not reason. The vehicle may also feel like it is struggling to accelerate.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Rough shifts</h3>
            <p>
                The vehicle may feel as if it is refusing to change gears or the gear shifts is not as smooth as it used to be. While driving you may hear or feel a clunk when the vehicle shifts gears. It will also be difficultly for it to get up to speed.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Fluid leak</h3>
            <p>If you noticed that there is leaks spots of transmission oil (its usually red, dark red, or brown) in your driveway or garage floor that means the transmission has a leak. In some vehicles you can determine where the oil is leaking by laying down and using a cardboard to go under your car in the front and middle side.</p>
            <br> <br>

            <a name="Timing Belt" />
            <h1>Timing Belt</h1>
            <img src="../Pic/belt.png" width="350px" height="250px">
            <p>The timing belt is a part of an internal combustion engine that synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft so the engine's valves open and close at the right times during each cylinder's intake and exhaust strokes.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Bad Timing Belt Symptoms:</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Ticking noise coming from the engine</h3>
            <p>If you hear a ticking noise coming from the engine this is an sign that your timing belt is starting to wear out. The timing belt is very critical to the operation of your vehicle, so if you notice this warning sign you need to get it fixed by contacting a mechanic as soon as possible.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Engine will not ignite</h3>
            <p>If the timing belt is broken the engine will fail ignite. When you turn the key sometime you will hear the starter engage, but the vehicle will fail to turn on. There will be multiple damage done if the timing belt broke while the vehicle was on. This can include the cylinder head hardware, the crank bearing or oil pump inside the oil pan a</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Engine Misfires</h3>
            <p>Worn out timing belt can mess with the engine's fire rate. Since the timing belt is attached to pulleys that drive the crank and camshaft, the worn out belt will slip on the camshaft drive and cause one cylinder to open or close too early, there for causing a misfire sometimes. The longer you allow this the closer you get the result of a damaged engine.</p>
            <br><br>

            <a name="Brake" />
            <h1>Brakes/Rotors</h1>
            <img src="../Pic/brakes.png" width="400px" height="300px">
            <p>Brakes are the components that are attached to the rotors these are what help the vehicle slow down or stop moving.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Signs of bad brakes:</h3> <br>
            <h3>Squeeky noises</h3>
            <p>While you are reacting a stop you hear squeaky noises this is a sign that your brake pedals are wearing out and its time to replace them. If you ignore this for too long, your rotors will receive damage due to your worn out brakes.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Vibration</h3>
            <p>A vibration or pulsating brake pedal often means that you have warped rotors. While in using the brake the anti-lock brakes are not engaged.</p>
            <br><br>

            <a name="Radi" />
            <h1>Radiator</h1><img src="../Pic/Radi.png" width="400px" height="300px">
            <p>Radiator is the component in your vehicle that dissipates built up heat in the cooling system. As coolant runs through the radiator, the walls of the internal passageways start to develop a thick layer of scale.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Bad Radiator signs:</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Vehicle Overheating</h3>
            <p>If your vehicle is overheating your Radiator cap could be bad, clogged <strong>Heater Core</strong>, or there is a hole in one of the hoes causing the antifreeze to leak.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Bad Water Pump</h3>
            <p>Since the water pump uses the impeller to continuously move coolant through the hoses and passageways of the cooling system.Tough debris breaking away from the radiator will cause damage to the water pump. If the radiator stops cooling the fluid before it moves past the impeller, the high temperatures could also cause damage to the plastic parts. Eventually, pieces of the impeller will break off and disrupt the flow speed of the coolant.</p>
            <br><br>

            <a name="Fuel" />
            <h1>Fuel Pumps</h1>
            <p>The fuel pump is an integral element of any car or truck. Given the responsibility of literally pumping a vehicle's fuel from its tank to the engine.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Fuel Pump syntoms:</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Engine Sputters at High Speed</h3>
            <p>While driving your vehicle at consistently high speed, it begins to jerk or sputter then returns to normal. This is cause by a worn out <strong>Fuel Pumper</strong> that doesn't give enough pressure</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Losing Power While Accelerating</h3>
            <p>This problem is similar to the previous one above, the vehicle jerks during acceleration from a stop. This is caused by a malfunction starves the vehicle of increased flow and the power it needs to respond to your commands is not enough.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Engine Doesn't Start</h3>
            <p>The engine not starting is the final stage of the malfunctioning pump and the worse. This is caused Fuel Pump does not send fuel to the engine.You may hear the sparks try to ignite, but there is no fuel to burn simply because Fuel Pump has malfunction to this point.</p>
            <br><br>
            <a name="Engine" />
            <h1>Engine</h1>
            <img src="../Pic/Engine.png" width="400px" height="300px">
            <p>The Engine, pretty much the brain of your vehicle the major component that changes energy into mechanical motion or force.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Bad Engine Signs:</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Smoke Signals</h3>
            <p>When there is smoke come out of your tailpipe for front that is indicator that something is wrong. There are two color of smokes signals, blue and white. Blue smoke means the Oil is escaping from its passageway within the engine and is burning with the fuel. White smoke means the water condensation or antifreeze is mixing with the fuel supply. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Foul Smells</h3>
            <p>If you smell something bad in your vehicle and it stays there. This a signal that oil or coolant is leaking from their normally closed-loop systems. It may also be an indicator that Hazardous exhaust gases invaded your vehicle's interior. Burning rubber smells could mean that the drive belts have been worn out, damaged, or loose.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Loud Noises</h3>
            <p>Tapping or popping noises could be a signal that the engine's cylinder is about to detonate. The reason behind this is the gasoline ignites prematurely in the combustion chamber of the cylinders causing the this explosive damage.</p>
